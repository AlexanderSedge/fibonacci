# fibonacci
Simple fibonacci sequence generator for Cirrus Labs interview.

Takes user input to generate a fibonacci sequence of the desired length, using either a quick array-based method or the "classic" recursive method. Recursive method is much, much slower, but the point is to show I can do it for interview purposes.
